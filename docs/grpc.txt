GRPC service runs locally and available originally at localhost:5005, but we
use k8s (Kubernetes) service that modifies the route to localhost:30003.

You can get all gRPC-related files in the ./udaconnect/modules/api/grpc_service/
directory.

You should know, that gRPC service is wrapped into a Kafka service. If you want
to test the funcionality, please go through the enxt steps:
1. get the latest version of grpc-service from Docker
   richardvecsey/udaconnect-grpc:latest
   You can check the route in the ./deployment/udaconnect-grpc-service.yaml
   Requirements are in the ./modules/grpc/requirements.txt
2. navigate to the grpc-service environment
3. run the grpc_text.py (./modules/grpc/grpc_test.py) after the wsgi.py
   without Docker container
   or
   run the commands from grpc_text.py if you are using a Docker container
4. service is available at localhost:5005 or localhost:30003
